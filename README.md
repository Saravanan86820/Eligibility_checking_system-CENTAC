This README matches the **modern style of your OrthoDent README** with:  

- Status and technology badges  
- Table of contents  
- Sections for features, highlights, screenshots, installation, and folder structure  
- Code blocks for commands and config  

---

If you want, I can **also add an “API Endpoints” section** in the same style, in case your system has endpoints for AJAX checks or admin features.  

Do you want me to add that?
